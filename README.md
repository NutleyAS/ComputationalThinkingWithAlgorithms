# ComputationalThinkingWithAlgorithms
This repository contains software developed as part of the Computational Thinking with Algorithms module which is part of the HDip in Software Development at GMIT.

## Project

For this project I had to write a java application which will be used to benchmark five different sorting algorithms. I also had to write a report which introduces the algorithms you have chosen, and discusses the results of the benchmarking process.

The five sorting algorithms had to meet the following criteria.

  1. A simple comparison-based sort (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort or Insertion Sort).
  2. An efficient comparison-based sort (Merge Sort, Quicksort or Heap Sort).
  3. A non-comparison sort (Counting Sort, Bucket Sort or Radix Sort).
  4. Any other sorting algorithm of your choice.
  5. Any other sorting algorithm of your choice.

## Submission

This repository contains both the submitted writted project and the java application that was developed for this module. The pdf file contains the report that introduces the algorithms I had chosen, and discusses the results of the benchmarking process. The 'CTA_Project_2021' folder contains the java application that was developed.
